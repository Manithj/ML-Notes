# Unsupervised Learning Algorithms I

# **An Introduction to Unsupervised Learning**

**Learn about Unsupervised Learning!**

Unsupervised Learning describes a class of algorithms that find patterns from unlabelled or untagged data. In Supervised Learning, we deal with data that is labelled or tagged. For example, we predict continuous outcomes in *regression* (for instance, predicting housing prices) or categorical outcomes in *classification* (spam versus not spam, for example). However, often training data isn’t labelled in this manner and this is where unsupervised learning comes in! It relies on using the underlying distributions of features within the data to figure out clusters of similarity.

### **Why did we build this?**

Unsupervised learning methods are extremely important to the functioning of many real-world algorithms - think image recognition, ride-shares anticipating demands, snapchat filters and many more! There are three primary ways they’re used:

- *Clustering*: Identifying clusters within a dataset like identifying disease outbreak clusters or in natural language processing, in creating word clouds that are semantically related, etc.
- *Dimensionality Reduction/Feature Extraction*: They can be used to condense the number of features in a dataset with a high number of features before applying a supervised learning algorithm.
- *Automated Labelling/Tagging*: Unsupervised learning algorithms are immensely useful in categorizing uncategorized data and one can then perform the familiar classification/regression tasks using supervised learning.

### **What will you learn?**

In this module we will focus on two of the most commonly used unsupervised learning techniques - Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-Means Clustering. The former is most often used for dimensionality reduction and the latter is used in clustering problems primarily. After this module you will be able to:

- Perform dimensionality reduction using PCA
- Classify images using PCA
- Find clusters within data using K-Means
- Extract features using PCA and K-Means
